# CSCS ML tool report 2023
This is the space for the codes used to test some of the libraries mentioned in my report on ML tools.
Only a few of the tools are found here, some there was no time, some there was no free version, some were very complex to get installed and running.
This collection of tests is more of a learning experience for me, as it taught me to code my first ever model and compare various software.

Please ignore the many commits, I kept moving files and changing names, it was not due to adding and removing new inforation.

Tools tested here:
MLflow, TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, fast.ai, Evidently AI, Locust.
