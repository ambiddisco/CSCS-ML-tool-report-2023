This folder contains the code I used to test the visualisation tools.

To show that the tools function properly and also show if they have unique functions, all viasualisation are based on the same models.
All visualisations include logging and visualising the accuracy and loss of 6 variations on MNIST classifier models as a base.
Each tool can also display different graphs and information.
Most logging is done with default settings, to showcase the tool in its natural habitat.

To see the models used, with no logging code, see the MNIST-classifier-model.ipynb file, that also showcases the datapoints in the MNIST
handwritten digit recognition dataset.
